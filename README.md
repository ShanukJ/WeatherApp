# WeatherApp
The WeatherApp is developed using SwiftUI life cycle and
OpenWeatherMap APIs to show the current weather and forecasted
weather for a location chosen by the user. Users can input a place name
and get the current weather data displayed in real-time. The app is
capable of safely handling non-existent locations and non-alphabetic
entries. This project was self-managed. 

Technology used:
• SwiftUI
• OpenWeatherMap APIs
